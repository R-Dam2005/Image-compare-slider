# **Image Comparison Slider**
This repository contains the full code for an interactive image comparison slider.

The project is structured with:
- HTML: The foundational markup for the slider layout and structure.
- JavaScript: Inline JavaScript to handle dynamic slider functionality, including user interactivity.
- SCSS/CSS: Styles are written in SCSS for easier management and modularity, with a converted CSS file for users that can't use scss.

The slider allows users to compare two images interactively by sliding a button that adjusts the visibility of each image.


***Note:** The slider is responsive and you can use bootstrap*


**Example of the slider:**
